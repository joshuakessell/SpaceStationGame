Notes:

* Science Lab levels gate access to later tech.
* Many ship unlocks are gated behind specific SL tech and power tier so progression is layered, not flat.

SECTION 4. SHIP STATS AND FORMULAS TABLE
This table defines how to calculate each ship’s combat stats and how equipped upgrades (mods, tech) affect them.
Replit should model ships as objects with base stats plus layered modifiers:

Variables:

* Base_HP, Base_Shield, Base_HullStrength, Base_Initiative, Base_Move, Base_AttackSpeed, Base_EnergyRegen.
* Global bonuses from Science Lab tech.
* Per-ship equipped Mods (at most 2).
* Weapon-type bonuses (Plasma, EMP, Torpedo, etc.).
* Chassis role flags (Light Frame, Shielded Frame, Heavy Frame, Stealth Frame).

We express formulas in pseudocode.

| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light_Scout           | Light Frame                     | HP = 1000 * (1 + SL_ShieldPhys?0:0); Shield = 200 * (1 + SL_ShieldPhys?0.1:0); HullStrength = 0.05; Initiative = 140; Move = 3 tiles/turn; AttackSpeed = Fast; EnergyRegen = Low | Kinetic (Bullets), Thermal (later), Small EMP burst (later)                    | Offense mods (Plasma_Overcharge not allowed), Speed mods, Evasion mods   | SR-001, SL-001 (for Shield bonus) | Fast turn gain. Dies fast if focused. Good at deleting fragile backline once Thermal lock exists to reveal Stealth. |
| Shield_Guardian       | Shielded Frame                  | HP = 1500; Shield = 1000 * (1 + SL_ShieldPhys?0.1:0); HullStrength = 0.10; Initiative = 80; Move = 1; AttackSpeed = Medium; EnergyRegen = Medium                                 | Phaser, EMP (defensive burst), Short-range Kinetic                             | Defense mods (EMP_Hardening), Shield_Regen mods, Taunt-style threat mods | SR-002, SL-001, SL-002            | Acts as frontline tank. Weak to EMP. High Shield so EMP counters it hard.                                           |
| Plasma_Bruiser        | Heavy Frame                     | HP = 1800; Shield = 400; HullStrength = 0.20 * (1 + SL_AdaptiveHull?0.1:0); Initiative = 90; Move = 2; AttackSpeed = Medium; EnergyRegen = Medium                                | Plasma (AoE burn), Short-range Kinetic backup                                  | Offensive mods (Plasma_Overcharge), Hull buffs                           | SR-003, SL-003                    | Strong vs Heavy hull targets. Applies Plasma burn DoT that ignores part of HullStrength. Must close distance.       |
| EMP_Disruptor         | Light Frame                     | HP = 900; Shield = 300; HullStrength = 0.05; Initiative = 130; Move = 2; AttackSpeed = Slow; EnergyRegen = High                                                                  | EMP pulse (Shield shred + Initiative slow); weak backup Kinetic                | Control mods (EMP_Amplifier), Speed mods                                 | SR-004, SL-004                    | Deletes Shield then cripples Initiative. Very fragile. If killed early, enemy tanks stabilize.                      |
| Torpedo_Frigate       | Heavy Frame                     | HP = 2000; Shield = 500; HullStrength = 0.25 * (1 + SL_AdaptiveHull?0.1:0); Initiative = 70; Move = 1; AttackSpeed = Very Slow; EnergyRegen = Medium                             | Torpedoes / Rockets (burst, long cooldown, can hit backline), Kinetic fallback | Offensive mods (Torpedo_Amplifier), Defensive mods (Hull_Reinforcement)  | SR-005, SL-005                    | Opens fights with Hull Breach on priority targets. Needs protection because Initiative is low.                      |
| Support_Field_Drone   | Support Frame (counts as Light) | HP = 1100; Shield = 600 * (1 + SL_ShieldPhys?0.1:0); HullStrength = 0.08; Initiative = 100; Move = 2; AttackSpeed = Slow; EnergyRegen = High                                     | Support Beam (Shield restore + cleanse), Low-power Phaser poke                 | Support mods (Heal_Boost, Cleanse_Boost), Defensive mods                 | SR-006, SL-006                    | Extends survivability of tanks and slows attrition. Cleanses debuffs (removes Hull Breach, Systems Disrupt).        |
| Heavy_Bomber          | Heavy Frame                     | HP = 2400; Shield = 400; HullStrength = 0.30 * (1 + SL_AdaptiveHull?0.1:0); Initiative = 60; Move = 1; AttackSpeed = Slow; EnergyRegen = Medium                                  | Plasma Bomb (AoE + Hull Breach), Thermal Bomb                                  | Offensive mods (Plasma_Overcharge, Breach_Extender), Hull mods           | SR-007, SL-003, SL-008            | Siege role. Breaks entrenched tanks. Very slow. Needs escort.                                                       |
| Stealth_Recon         | Stealth Frame                   | HP = 1000; Shield = 300; HullStrength = 0.10; Initiative = 150 * (1 + SL_QuantumWarp?0.15:0); Move = 3 (teleport-like); AttackSpeed = Medium; EnergyRegen = Medium               | Kinetic precision strike, Thermal lock-on (reveals stealth), light Torpedo     | Offensive mods (Crit_Boost, Speed_Boost), Stealth_Field mod              | SR-008, SL-007                    | Bypasses frontline, targets enemy backline units. Weak to Thermal.                                                  |
| Aegis_Command_Carrier | Shielded Heavy Frame            | HP = 4000; Shield = 2000 * (1 + SL_ShieldPhys?0.1:0); HullStrength = 0.35 * (1 + SL_AdaptiveHull?0.1:0); Initiative = 50; Move = 1; AttackSpeed = Slow; EnergyRegen = High       | Phaser arrays, Team Aura Projector                                             | Defensive mods (EMP_Hardening, Aura_Extender), Support mods              | SR-009, SL-009                    | Provides team aura: +Shield Regen, +Resistance. Keystone unit in late-game comps. High cost and long build time.    |

Explanation of formula references:

* `SL_ShieldPhys` means player has researched SL-001 Basic Shield Physics.
* `SL_AdaptiveHull` means player has researched SL-008 Adaptive Hull Matrix.
* `SL_QuantumWarp` means player has researched SL-007 Quantum Warp Stabilizer.

Final stat calculation for a ship instance at battle load-in should apply in order:

1. Start from base line in this table.
2. Apply global tech bonuses from unlocked Science Lab tech.
3. Apply per-ship equipped Mods (max 2):

   * Example DefensiveMod_EMP_Hardening: `Incoming_EMP_Damage *= 0.6` and `Systems_Disrupt_Duration *= 0.6`.
   * Example OffensiveMod_Plasma_Overcharge: `Plasma_Damage *= 1.2` and `Plasma_Burn_Duration += 1 turn`.
4. Apply temporary pre-battle buffs (if any future commander skills are added).
5. Use final stats in combat loop.

Damage mitigation in battle:

* When resolving damage to Hull:
  `FinalHullDamage = RawHullDamage * (1 - HullStrengthAfterBonuses)`
  except where weapon ignores part of HullStrength:

  * Plasma: ignore 50% of HullStrength
    `EffectiveHullStrength = HullStrengthAfterBonuses * 0.5`
  * Torpedo: treat HullStrengthAfterBonuses as 0.5x for first impact hit if Hull Breach is applied afterward.

Shield interaction in battle:

* EMP damage to Shield is doubled (2.0x) before Shield subtraction.
* Torpedo damage to Shield is reduced to 0.75x before Shield subtraction.

Initiative in battle:

* Each ship has Initiative value (after mods, after tech).
* Turn_Meter += Initiative per tick.
* When Turn_Meter >= 1000, ship takes a turn and Turn_Meter -= 1000.
* Debuff "Systems Disrupt" from EMP:
  `Initiative *= 0.7`
  `MovementSpeedTiles *= 0.7`
  for debuff duration.

Movement in battle:

* MovementSpeedTiles is the Move stat in tiles/turn.
* Stealth_Recon can "blink" 3 tiles ignoring blockers if SL-007 unlocked.

Compatibility enforcement:

* A ship may only mount weapons defined under Compatible_Weapons.
* A ship may only equip Mods in Compatible_Mods.
* A ship cannot equip more than 2 Mods total.
* A ship may not equip duplicate Mods (same ID twice).
* Some Mods require Tech_ID from Science Lab. Enforce prereq at equip time, not at battle time.

Unlock/build logic:

* A chassis cannot be constructed unless its SR-### is unlocked AND the appropriate Foundry tier building exists at required level AND required Science Lab tech has been researched AND station Power_Module tier is available (enough power budget).
* If any prereq is missing, UI should show it as locked with "Requires X".

With these four tables (Mining Drone Research, Ship Research Module, Science Lab Tech, Ship Stats/Formulas), Replit has:

* All research dependencies
* Costs and timers
* Unlock rules
* Stat formulas and battle math
* Compatibility limits for gear / mods / weapons
* Power tier and lab tier gates

This is sufficient to:

1. Implement build/research trees.
2. Gate chassis availability by research and infrastructure.
3. Compute combat stats at runtime from base chassis + tech + mods.
4. Run deterministic turn-based auto combat with initiative, movement, range, weapon type, shield/hull interaction, elemental (tech signature) advantage, and debuffs.
