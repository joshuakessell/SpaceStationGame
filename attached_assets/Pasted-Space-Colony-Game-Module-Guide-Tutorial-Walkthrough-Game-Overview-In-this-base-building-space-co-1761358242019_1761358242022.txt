Space Colony Game Module Guide & Tutorial Walkthrough
Game Overview
In this base-building space colony game, players start with a fledgling outpost and gradually expand it by constructing and upgrading modules (buildings) that unlock new capabilities. The design follows a tiered progression: initial gameplay is simple and fast-paced, then complexity increases step-by-step as new resource types and modules are introduced. This “unfolding systems” approach is critical so that players aren’t overwhelmed early on

. At first, only a few basic systems are active; as the player progresses, additional layers (new resources, units, and challenges) come into play one by one. Core Resources: There are four main resources that gate progression and construction: Gold, Metal, Crystals, and Exotic Items. Lower-tier resources are abundant and used for most basic constructions, while higher-tier resources are scarcer and required for advanced projects. Many successful strategy games use a similar multi-resource model – for example, OGame features metal, crystal, and deuterium as the “3 basic resources required by all emerging empires for construction of structures, ships, and research”
ogame.fandom.com
. In our game design, Metal is the most common material (analogous to OGame’s metal), and Gold serves as a general currency, whereas Crystals are a more advanced resource needed for high-tech modules. Exotic items are rare artifacts or components required for top-tier units and buildings. As in other games, the basic resources have lower relative value while advanced resources are more precious (e.g. metal is abundant and “its value is considered to be the lowest of all resources for trading”
ogame.fandom.com
). Players will start with a stockpile of gold (and a small amount of metal) to bootstrap initial building, and will unlock metal mining early on. Crystals and exotic items come into play later, once the necessary infrastructure is built. Base Modules and Command Center: The player’s base consists of various modules (buildings) each serving a specific purpose (resource production, storage, unit fabrication, etc.). Crucially, the Command Center is the central hub of the base and dictates the overall advancement. The Command Center’s level caps the level of all other modules – no module can exceed the Command Center’s level. This means the Command Center must be upgraded to unlock higher module upgrades and new building types. Many base-building games follow this paradigm: for instance, in War Commander “the Command Center is the hub of all base activity. Upgrade the Command Center to unlock new buildings, upgrade existing buildings, and enhance defenses and resource producers.”
warcommander.fandom.com
 In our game, upgrading the Command Center will not only improve base capacity but also unlock new modules and higher upgrade levels for those modules. Each module in the base has a purpose and a set of levels that increase its effectiveness. Players can click on any module to view detailed information – such as its current level, what it does, and the benefits of the next level – fostering transparency in what each upgrade or building provides. Incremental Complexity & Player Engagement: As the game progresses, each new module is introduced with a clear purpose, teaching the player a new aspect of gameplay. Early on, actions complete quickly (in seconds or minutes) and resources are easy to obtain, giving immediate feedback. Over time, build and upgrade durations grow longer and resource requirements increase significantly, slowing the pace for advanced projects. To keep players engaged during these longer waits, the design ensures there is “always something productive to do, something to work towards” at any given moment

. For example, while a large building upgrade counts down, the player can manage other tasks like sending exploration drones to gather exotic items or reorganizing their base. All systems work in synergy to avoid repetitive grinding – mining, base-building, and exploration provide different but complementary challenges so the gameplay loop stays varied
reddit.com
. This approach mirrors the pacing of successful idle/strategy hybrids, where offline progress is possible but active play is rewarded with additional side activities rather than simply waiting
reddit.com
. In summary, the player will progress through a tech-tree of modules and units: starting with basic mining drones for Metal, then moving to advanced mining for Crystals, and eventually producing Attack Robots that require exotic components. Each stage introduces new module types (with associated upgrades and resource costs) in a logical sequence. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of all modules (buildings) in the game’s first phase, including their purpose, unlock conditions, and upgrade progression. Following that, a step-by-step tutorial walkthrough is provided, demonstrating the intended gameplay path for new players – from establishing a mining operation to deploying their first combat units.
Resources
Before detailing the modules, it’s important to understand the resources players will be managing:
Gold – A universal currency for construction and trade. Gold is used in most building and upgrade costs, especially at low levels. Early in the game, the player starts with a reserve of Gold to kickstart development. Gold can be acquired later via missions or trade (for example, selling surplus metal) and occasionally as a minor byproduct of mining rich asteroids. It is stored in a Gold Vault (or the Command Center’s vault) up to a limit that can be increased by upgrades. Gold is relatively common in the early game but remains important throughout as a baseline resource for transactions.
Metal – The primary construction material for structures and units. Metal is abundant and forms the backbone of the economy (e.g. used to build module frames, drone chassis, etc.). It must be mined from nearby asteroids using mining drones. Metal starts off as the most plentiful resource; it’s needed in large quantities for almost all upgrades. Because of its abundance, metal alone is insufficient for advanced technology (higher-tier content will demand additional resources). Players will build Metal Depots to increase storage capacity so they can stockpile metal for expensive upgrades. Metal’s production and storage need to be managed to ensure the base can expand steadily.
Crystals – An advanced resource required for high-tech modules and units (such as advanced electronics, energy weapons, or sophisticated components). Crystals are rarer than metal and become accessible only after the player upgrades their base and constructs specialized facilities. Think of crystals as the “next tier” resource – for example, in OGame, Crystal is the second fundamental resource needed for more complex constructions
ogame.fandom.com
. In this game, crystals are found in certain asteroid clusters or deposits that are initially out of reach; only once you upgrade your Command Center and mining tech can you tap into them. Players will need to build a Crystal Mine/Extractor module to harvest crystals. Crystals are used in the construction of advanced modules (like a robot factory) and in crafting sophisticated units. They are stored in a Crystal Vault to maintain a reserve. Crystal availability is a turning point in progression – once players can mine it, new possibilities (and requirements) open up.
Exotic Items – A catch-all category for rare components, artifacts, or special materials required for the most advanced creations (such as building powerful attack robots, starships, or top-tier module upgrades). Exotic items are not produced in the base like other resources; instead, they must be found or salvaged through exploration and missions. They represent unique tech – for example, alien relics, advanced circuitry, or rare elements – which cannot be obtained from regular mining. In gameplay terms, exotics are analogous to special resources in other games that gate endgame content (e.g. War Commander’s Thorium resource gates high-level upgrades
kixeyesupport.helpshift.com
). To acquire exotic items, players will deploy Explorer Drones on expeditions (or engage in combat missions) to scavenge these items. This can happen passively (idle players can let a drone automatically search over time) or actively (via interactive missions, planned for a later update). Initially we will implement the idle method: if the player prefers not to wait idly, they can assign a drone to continuously forage; over time it will automatically bring back exotic components. Active foraging (e.g. a mini-game or manual mission for exotics) is planned for the future, but not included in the first version. Exotic items are usually required in small quantities – for example, a single Attack Robot might need one exotic component (like an AI core or a power module) along with a lot of metal and crystal. These items are stored in a secure vault or the Command Center (their storage doesn’t usually require a separate building due to their rarity, though we might treat the Command Center as having a small default capacity for them). The need for exotic items ensures that late-game progress depends on exploring beyond the base – adding an adventurous element to the otherwise resource-management gameplay.
With these resources in mind, let’s detail the game’s modules. Each module description below lists its purpose, unlock requirements, and an upgrade table outlining levels 1–5 (with resource costs, build times, and key effects). Note that all modules are limited by the Command Center level – meaning the Command Center must be upgraded first before other modules can reach the equivalent level. This rule ensures a clear hierarchy in progression and prevents rushing one aspect too far ahead of the base’s overall level.
Module Overview and Upgrade Details
Command Center (CC)
Purpose: The Command Center is the heart of the base. It coordinates all operations and must be upgraded to unlock new modules and higher upgrade levels for other buildings. The Command Center also provides basic storage for resources and might house command capabilities like scanning for asteroid fields. Upgrading the CC often expands the base’s buildable area or scanning radius and increases the maximum level of other structures. It also often improves storage capacity for basic resources and the durability (HP) of the base. Importantly, no other module’s level can exceed the Command Center’s level – this enforces that the player must invest in overall base advancement to access higher-tier content (a design feature common in strategy games
warcommander.fandom.com
). Unlock Requirements: The Command Center is available from the start at Level 1 (it is the first structure in place when the game begins). Upgrading the Command Center to higher levels will often have prerequisites (for example, certain other buildings might need to be built/upgraded first – see below). Being the central module, upgrading it is typically a major goal that requires significant resources and time. Upgradeable: Yes – the Command Center can be upgraded to increase base level. Each upgrade unlocks new modules or higher upgrade caps and may provide other bonuses (like more storage or defense). The CC must be at least equal level (or higher) compared to any other module. Upgrade Progression:
CC Level	Unlocks / Effects	Upgrade Cost	Upgrade Time	Prerequisites
Level 1	Starting base. Basic modules (Mining Hub, Metal Depot). Provides base storage (e.g. 1000 Metal, 500 Crystal, 5000 Gold capacity). Scanning radius: local asteroids.	N/A (starting level)	N/A (built-in)	None (initial structure)
Level 2	Unlocks ability to build additional resource producers (e.g. +1 Mining Drone Hub capacity, ability to build Metal Depot storage). Increases max level of basic modules to 2. Scanning radius +20%.	500 Gold, 600 Metal	5 minutes	None (just resource cost)
Level 3	Unlocks Fusion Reactor and Crystal Mine modules (new resource tier). Increases max module level to 3. Scanning radius +20% (can now detect crystal-rich asteroids). Improves base storage capacity (+500 Metal, +200 Crystal).	1,500 Gold, 3,000 Metal	15 minutes	Mining Drone Hub Lv2, Metal Depot Lv1 (to ensure capacity for cost)
Level 4	Unlocks Attack Robot Factory and Explorer Drone Bay (combat units & exploration). Increases max level to 4. Scanning radius +10%. Base storage +200 Crystal.	3,000 Gold, 5,000 Metal, 1,000 Crystals	1 hour	Crystal Mine Lv1 (player must have crystals), Fusion Reactor Lv1
Level 5	Unlocks Starship Hangar (ability to build small starships) and higher-tier defenses (future content). Increases max level to 5. Base storage +1 Exotic item capacity.	5,000 Gold, 10,000 Metal, 2,000 Crystals, 1 Exotic	4 hours	Attack Robot Factory Lv1, at least 1 Exotic item acquired (for proof-of-concept)
Notes: At Level 1, the Command Center provides just enough capacity to get started. By Level 3, the Command Center’s improved scanners reveal new resource nodes containing crystals (which were previously hidden). The prerequisites listed ensure the player has engaged with the available content before upgrading (e.g. requiring a Mining Hub upgrade before CC3 encourages the player to improve mining efficiency first). By Level 4, the base is advanced enough to delve into combat units and exploration. Level 5 introduces the possibility of building a starship, pushing the player toward the next frontier (though that may be beyond the initial tutorial’s scope). Each CC upgrade is significant and should feel like a milestone; the time and cost reflect that (notice the jump in required crystals and even an exotic item for CC5). This mirrors how other games gate advanced content: for example, War Commander requires constructing a Thorium Vault and having CC level 2+ before you can build a Thorium Mine
kixeyesupport.helpshift.com
 – a comparable concept to needing crystals and a reactor in place before upgrading our CC to 4 or 5.
Mining Drone Hub
Purpose: The Mining Drone Hub (sometimes just called Drone Hub or Drone Factory) is the facility that produces and houses Mining Drones. Mining Drones are units that travel to asteroid clusters to collect metal (and possibly small amounts of gold or other minerals) and bring them back to the base. The Drone Hub determines how many mining drones you can deploy at once and how efficiently they operate. Upgrading the Drone Hub increases the number of drones available and the rate at which they can be built or deployed, thereby boosting metal income. Unlock Requirements: Unlocked from the start (available at Command Center Level 1). This is typically the first module the player builds in the tutorial. No prerequisite buildings aside from the starting CC are needed for the basic Drone Hub. (We assume the player’s initial base can support constructing one immediately using starting resources.) Upgradeable: Yes. A higher-level Drone Hub supports more simultaneous drones and faster drone construction. It may also unlock more advanced drone types if any (for example, if later we introduce specialized mining drones or improvements like better cargo capacity per drone). Key Functions:
Build Mining Drones: The hub allows the player to spend resources (mainly metal and gold) to construct mining drones. A newly built drone can then be assigned to an asteroid cluster to gather resources.
Assign Drones to Asteroids: Through the Drone Hub interface, the player can choose from discovered asteroid clusters and assign available drones to start mining them. Different clusters may yield different amounts or types of resources (e.g. one asteroid might be metal-rich, another might contain trace gold or other metals).
Drone Capacity: The Drone Hub at level 1 might support, say, 2 mining drones deployed at once. Upgrades increase this cap (e.g. 4 drones at level 2, 6 at level 3, etc., depending on balance).
Efficiency: Upgrades could also slightly improve mining efficiency or speed (or this could depend on drone upgrades, but initially assume Drone Hub handles basic improvements like coordination systems that let drones mine faster).
Upgrade Progression:
Drone Hub Level	Max Drones Deployed	Effects & Upgrades	Upgrade Cost	Upgrade Time	Prerequisite
Level 1	2 drones	Can build basic Mining Drones (each drone gathers ~50 Metal per trip). Initial mining rate ~50 Metal/min per drone (depending on asteroid).	300 Gold, 0 Metal<sup>1</sup>	10 seconds	Command Center L1 (starting)
Level 2	4 drones	+2 drone capacity (4 total). Slightly faster drone build time. Increases mining rate (each drone +10% efficiency).	500 Gold, 200 Metal	1 minute	Command Center L2
Level 3	6 drones	+2 drone capacity (6 total). Drones haul more per trip or mine deeper (another +10% efficiency). This high level of hub is needed to manage advanced mining operations (useful when crystal mining begins).	800 Gold, 500 Metal	5 minutes	Command Center L3
Level 4	8 drones	+2 drone capacity (8 total). Enables Advanced Drones upgrade (if applicable in future) or further speed improvements.	1,200 Gold, 1,000 Metal, 100 Crystal	15 minutes	Command Center L4
Level 5	10 drones	+2 drone capacity (10 total). Maximized mining output for current game phase. Might allow minor Crystal mining ability for drones (e.g. drones assist crystal extractor or gather small crystal remnants).	2,000 Gold, 2,000 Metal, 300 Crystal	30 minutes	Command Center L5
<small><sup>1</sup> Drone Hub Level 1 is assumed to be built using mostly Gold (the player’s starting resource) because initially the player has little or no Metal. This allows the player to construct the hub and then start mining Metal.</small> Notes: The Mining Drone Hub is central to the early game loop. At level 1 it costs only gold so the player can get it running immediately. Once built, the player can create mining drones. Mining Drones themselves might cost a small amount of resources – for instance, each drone could cost 50 Metal (representing materials to build it) and some gold for electronics. The tutorial likely provides enough starting metal (or perhaps the first drone is free) to ensure the player can deploy at least one drone. As the hub is upgraded, more drones can operate in parallel, dramatically increasing metal income to meet growing costs in mid-game. We tie the max number of drones to the hub’s level as a form of soft cap on resource gathering – the player must invest in infrastructure to scale up mining, rather than just spamming drones. This is analogous to how War Commander limits the number of resource producers by Command Center level
kixeyesupport.helpshift.com
kixeyesupport.helpshift.com
, although here we implement it via the Drone Hub module. By Drone Hub Level 3, the base is ready for intensive resource extraction, which coincides with unlocking crystal mining (the player will likely want a strong metal income to support building the crystal extractor). We also included a small crystal cost for hub level 4+ to ensure by that stage the player has started crystal production (this also balances that you shouldn’t easily max out the mining hub without diversifying into crystals). Mining Drone Unit: (For completeness, details on the drones built by the Drone Hub) – A Mining Drone is a small robotic craft that flies out to an asteroid, mines ore, and returns with cargo. In-game, this is represented either by a periodic resource income or by an actual drone unit visible traveling back and forth. Each drone has a certain carry capacity and mining rate. For example, a basic mining drone might carry 50 Metal per trip and make one trip per minute from a nearby asteroid, yielding ~50 Metal per minute. If multiple resource types are present, drones prioritize Metal but could bring back a little Gold as well (e.g. 5 Gold along with the 50 Metal, reflecting precious metals found). The player can allocate drones to different asteroids if multiple are available – for instance, if one asteroid has some gold, the player might send 1 of their drones there to collect a mix of gold/metal, and the rest to a pure metal asteroid. Asteroid clusters on the map can have different profiles (one might be “High Metal, Low Gold”, another “Moderate Metal, Chance of Crystal fragment”, etc.). This adds a strategic choice element. However, in the very beginning, likely only one asteroid cluster is introduced to keep things simple, then a second one is revealed to demonstrate choice (e.g. one rich in metal vs one that’s slower but gives a trickle of gold). Drone assignments can be changed at any time, but travel and mining take time, so efficiency is key. The Drone Hub’s interface could show each drone’s assignment and incoming resources. Upgrading the Hub and drones will improve these parameters (e.g. faster travel, more capacity), but initially the values are low. The tutorial will cover how to build a drone and assign it to get the first Metal income.
Metal Depot (Metal Storage)
Purpose: The Metal Depot is a storage module that increases the base’s capacity to store Metal. Since metal is gathered continuously by mining drones, there is a limit to how much can be stockpiled at once. The Command Center has a small inherent storage (e.g. 1000 units of metal initially), but to accumulate large quantities for expensive upgrades (like Command Center upgrades or high-level modules), players must build and upgrade Metal Depots. Without sufficient storage, any metal mined beyond the cap is wasted, halting progress. So expanding storage is critical as the economy grows. Unlock Requirements: Unlocked early – available at Command Center Level 1 (or Level 2 at the latest). The initial Depot can be constructed once the base is set up. In fact, the tutorial may prompt the player to build a Metal Depot when they are close to the starting storage limit. There are no advanced prerequisites, but building one costs some resources (likely Gold, since spending metal to increase metal capacity beyond current cap can be problematic if you’re at cap – typically storage upgrades use a different resource to avoid that issue). Upgradeable: Yes. Higher levels of Metal Depot provide greater metal storage capacity. You can also build multiple depots if allowed, but in this design we’ll assume one Metal Depot module that can be upgraded to expand capacity (simpler for now). Alternatively, the game could allow multiple Metal Depots (each level 1 gives X capacity, etc.), but here we outline a single upgradeable depot for simplicity. Upgrade Progression:
Metal Depot Level	Metal Storage Capacity (+additional)	Upgrade Cost	Time	Prerequisites
Level 1	+2,000 Metal capacity (total metal cap becomes CC base 1,000 + 2,000 = 3,000)	200 Gold, 0 Metal<sup>2</sup>	30 seconds	Command Center L1 (or L2)
Level 2	+5,000 Metal capacity (cumulative cap ~8,000 total)	400 Gold, 100 Metal	2 minutes	Command Center L2
Level 3	+10,000 Metal capacity (cumulative ~18,000)	800 Gold, 500 Metal	5 minutes	Command Center L3
Level 4	+20,000 Metal capacity (cumulative ~38,000)	1,200 Gold, 1,000 Metal, 100 Crystal	15 min	Command Center L4
Level 5	+50,000 Metal capacity (cumulative ~88,000)	2,000 Gold, 2,000 Metal, 500 Crystal	30 min	Command Center L5
<small><sup>2</sup> Metal Depot Level 1 uses primarily Gold for cost, so that the player can build it even if their metal is at capacity. This avoids a catch-22 where they need more storage but can’t accumulate metal due to being capped.</small> Notes: The exact capacity numbers can be tuned, but the idea is that each upgrade dramatically increases how much metal can be stored. For instance, to upgrade Command Center to Level 3 we set a cost of ~3,000 Metal – this is impossible to hold with just the initial 1,000 capacity, so the player must build (and possibly upgrade) a Metal Depot to proceed. In the table above, building a Level 1 Depot raises capacity to 3,000, exactly enough for CC3’s requirement in our example. Similarly, CC4 might require 5,000 Metal (our CC4 cost was 5,000), which is beyond 3,000, so a Level 2 Depot (8,000 cap) is needed by then. This gating ensures players expand storage in tandem with other upgrades, which is a common design in base builders (e.g., Clash of Clans requires gold storage upgrades to hold enough gold for Town Hall upgrades). The Depot costs mostly gold (and later a bit of metal) to upgrade, which encourages spending a different resource to raise the metal cap. At higher levels we introduced a small crystal cost as well – by Depot L4, the player likely has crystal income, and requiring some crystal ensures they are utilizing the new resource tier for improvements. The Metal Depot doesn’t have any flashy gameplay effect; it’s purely to allow growth. The tutorial will point out when the player hits capacity and prompt them to use excess metal (e.g. start an upgrade or build storage). Also, note that if multiple Metal Depots were allowed, the total capacities would sum up – but in this plan we stick to one upgradable depot. (Similar storage modules exist for other resources: see Gold Vault and Crystal Vault below.)
Gold Vault (Gold Storage)
Purpose: The Gold Vault increases storage capacity for Gold, the currency resource. While gold is not mined like metal, the player can accumulate gold from missions, trades, or as a secondary yield from certain asteroid mining. The vault ensures the player doesn’t waste any gold collected when they hit the default cap. Initially, the Command Center itself may hold a sizeable amount of gold (since gold might represent credit reserves), but as the game progresses and more gold is earned, a dedicated vault prevents overflow. Additionally, storing gold securely could be a thematic element (protecting your credits from theft if there were raids, though PvP is not in scope initially). Unlock Requirements: Available early (Command Center L1). The starting gold cap might be relatively high so the Vault isn’t immediately necessary, but it should be available to build if the player is a hoarder or receives a windfall of gold. For example, if starting gold capacity is 5,000 and the player starts with 1,000 gold, they won’t need a vault right away. But if they plan to accumulate, say, 10,000 gold over time through trade, they’ll need to upgrade storage. Upgradeable: Yes, to allow larger gold reserves. However, gold usually isn’t needed in extremely large quantities for a single purchase (costs are spread across resources), so upgrading gold storage might be lower priority. Still, for completeness, we provide upgrade levels. Upgrade Progression:
Gold Vault Level	Gold Storage Capacity	Upgrade Cost	Time	Prerequisites
Level 1	+5,000 Gold capacity (added to base CC capacity) – e.g. total goes from 5k to 10k	0 Gold, 500 Metal	1 minute	Command Center L1
Level 2	+10,000 Gold capacity (total ~20k)	0 Gold, 1,000 Metal	2 minutes	Command Center L2
Level 3	+20,000 Gold capacity (total ~40k)	0 Gold, 2,000 Metal	5 minutes	Command Center L3
Level 4	+50,000 Gold capacity (total ~90k)	0 Gold, 5,000 Metal, 200 Crystal	15 min	Command Center L4
Level 5	+100,000 Gold capacity (total ~190k)	0 Gold, 10,000 Metal, 500 Crystal	30 min	Command Center L5
Notes: Gold Vault upgrades are listed as costing Metal (and later some Crystal) but no Gold. This is intentional, because if the player’s gold is at cap, they might not be able to spend gold (since any excess from rewards would be lost). By using metal to upgrade gold storage, we avoid that issue. The progression here is generous; likely, a Level 1 vault might not be needed until mid-game, but we include it for symmetry. Depending on how the economy is tuned, the starting gold capacity provided by the Command Center might be enough for early game (e.g. hold a few thousand gold). We want to make sure gold storage isn’t a bottleneck while metal and crystals are more pressing. In many games, primary resources (like metal) need storage upgrades more frequently than currency does. So the Gold Vault might remain at level 1 or 2 for a while, which is fine. It exists mainly for completeness and future-proofing (especially if later on, players might accumulate large gold through trading, events, or idle income). The tutorial may not even explicitly require building a Gold Vault unless the player somehow hits the gold cap (which is unlikely in the very early game unless they don’t spend at all). However, the UI can show that a vault is available if needed, and a tip could mention it when gold gets high.
Crystal Mine (Crystal Harvester)
Purpose: The Crystal Mine (or Crystal Harvester/Extractor) is the module that enables extraction of Crystals, the second-tier resource. Unlike metal which is abundant, crystals are found only in special deposits (perhaps specific asteroids or geological formations). The Crystal Mine represents the advanced mining facility or processing plant needed to gather and refine crystals. Building this allows the player to start producing crystals, which are required for advanced buildings and units (like the Attack Robot Factory, high-level upgrades, etc.). Essentially, the Crystal Mine opens the “mid-game” resource layer. Unlock Requirements: The Crystal Mine is unlocked at Command Center Level 3. Additionally, it has a prerequisite of having a functional power source – specifically, a Fusion Reactor Level 1 must be built first to supply the energy needed for crystal extraction. (Crystalline deposits might be deep or require high-powered lasers to mine.) We also require the player to have developed their mining infrastructure: for example, ensuring Mining Drone Hub is upgraded (to L2 or L3) could be a soft requirement, since advanced resource extraction builds on efficient basic mining. In practice, the CC3 requirement enforces that anyway (since CC3 itself we set to need Drone Hub L2 in the CC upgrade prerequisites). So to summarize: Requires Command Center L3 and a Fusion Reactor. The War Commander analogy is that to unlock Thorium (their advanced resource), you needed to build a Thorium Vault and have CC2+
kixeyesupport.helpshift.com
. In our case, we require building the reactor first (for power) at CC3, then the Crystal Mine. Construction Cost: Building the Crystal Mine will be one of the first structures that costs a significant amount of metal and perhaps some gold. It might also require a small quantity of crystals to build — this is a design choice: we could either assume the first crystals are obtained through a story event or a tiny amount from asteroids. However, to simplify, we will not require crystals to build the level 1 Crystal Mine (because the player has none yet). Instead, it will cost Metal and Gold, and possibly use the new Fusion Reactor’s power capacity. Operation: Once built, the Crystal Mine will start extracting crystals from identified deposits. We might treat it similarly to a resource producer that works continuously (like a mine that generates X crystals per hour). Or we might require assigning a special Crystal Drone or using existing drones with upgrades. For the initial design, it’s straightforward to have the Crystal Mine produce crystals passively (like a building with a production rate) since we’ve already introduced active gathering with drones for metal. To differentiate, we can say the Crystal Mine uses heavy machinery (drills, chemical processes) to extract crystals from a concentrated deposit beneath the base or nearby, so it doesn’t require the player to send out units — it just needs to be staffed/powered and it will yield crystals over time. Upgrades increase this rate. Upgradeable: Yes. Higher levels of the Crystal Mine yield more crystals per hour (and possibly store a bit more before collection). Upgrading could also allow mining of purer crystal or reduce power consumption per unit. Upgrade Progression:
Crystal Mine Level	Crystal Production Rate	Effects	Upgrade Cost	Time	Prerequisites
Level 1	5 Crystals/hour (base rate)	Enables crystal resource production. Uses significant power from Reactor (e.g. consumes 5 Power units). Low storage (capacity for ~20 crystals before needing collection).	1,000 Gold, 2,000 Metal	10 minutes	Command Center L3; Fusion Reactor L1 built
Level 2	10 Crystals/hour	+100% production speed (10/hour). Increases local crystal storage to 50. Slightly more power draw (7 Power).	500 Gold, 3,000 Metal, 50 Crystals	30 minutes	Command Center L4
Level 3	20 Crystals/hour	+100% production (20/hour). Crystal extraction process improved. Power use up to 10.	1,000 Gold, 5,000 Metal, 200 Crystals	1 hour	Command Center L5
Level 4	30 Crystals/hour	Improved efficiency (30/hr). Maybe unlocks refinement for higher purity crystals (could tie into future tech). Power use 12.	2,000 Gold, 8,000 Metal, 500 Crystals	2 hours	(Future content unlock, CC >5)
Level 5	50 Crystals/hour	Max theoretical output for current deposit (50/hr). Power use 15.	5,000 Gold, 10,000 Metal, 1000 Crystals, 1 Exotic	4 hours	(Future content, CC >5)
Notes: At Level 1, the Crystal Mine gives the player their first steady income of crystals. The rate is intentionally low (e.g. 5 per hour) because crystals are valuable. The idea is that even a small number of crystals will unlock new possibilities (for example, building one Attack Robot might need 20 crystals, which at 5/hour takes 4 hours unless the player upgrades or builds more). Upgrading the Crystal Mine doubles the output each time initially, quickly raising the crystal income to a more usable level. However, each upgrade itself requires crystals, which forces the player to use some of what they’ve produced to improve production – a classic dilemma of invest now to produce more later. For instance, Crystal Mine Level 2 might cost 50 crystals; the player would accumulate those over 10 hours at 5/hour if they don’t find other sources or accelerate it. This creates a natural time progression or pushes the player to get multiple crystal sources if possible (though likely only one mine is allowed, as per War Commander’s one Thorium mine limit
kixeyesupport.helpshift.com
). Perhaps instead of making them wait that long, the game could provide some initial crystal stock (say the first few crystals from a mission or quest), just to get the ball rolling. This can be decided in balancing. Power consumption is noted because we introduced a Fusion Reactor. We assume the Reactor has a certain output (we’ll detail reactor next) and each power-hungry module like the Crystal Mine will consume a portion of it. If power is insufficient, the Crystal Mine might operate at reduced efficiency or not at all. So the player may need to upgrade the Reactor or build more (if multiple allowed) to keep everything running at full capacity. This is an added layer of management introduced at this stage, inspired by games like OGame where higher mines require more energy
ogame.fandom.com

. It makes the gameplay deeper: the player must balance resource production with energy supply. Crystal Collection: The Crystal Mine likely holds the crystals it extracts in an internal storage until the player “collects” them (similar to how resource producers in War Commander or Clash of Clans work: they generate until full, then you tap to collect into your main stockpile). We gave an example of 20 capacity at level 1 – meaning every 4 hours it would fill with ~20 crystals if not collected. The player should empty it to the Crystal Vault (or Command Center) to use those crystals. If the vault is full, extraction stops, so that encourages building/upgrading the Crystal Vault too. Crystal Vault (Storage): It’s analogous to the Metal Depot but for crystals. Let’s define it briefly:
Crystal Vault – Unlocked at Command Center 3 (since before that, crystals weren’t available). It increases how many crystals can be stored in the base inventory. Initial crystal storage from the Command Center might be minimal (like 100 or 200 units) to allow a bit of buffer, but any serious quantity requires a vault.
Costs – Likely uses Metal (and some Gold) to upgrade, avoiding needing crystals to upgrade its own storage at least for the first level.
Progression – For example, Level 1 vault might add +200 capacity, Level 2 +500, Level 3 +1000, etc. So if initial CC gives 200, building a vault takes it to 400 or more, etc. We might need a Level 1 vault pretty soon because if CC’s cap is only 200, after a day of production the player might hit it. However, early on they’ll be spending crystals as fast as they get them on new buildings/units, so capacity might not immediately be an issue. But by the time they approach needing hundreds of crystals for upgrades, a vault upgrade will be necessary.
We can include a quick table for Crystal Vault for completeness:
Crystal Vault Upgrade Example:
Crystal Vault Level	Crystal Capacity	Upgrade Cost	Prerequisite
Level 1	+200 (total ~300)	500 Gold, 1,000 Metal	Command Center L3
Level 2	+500 (total ~800)	300 Gold, 2,000 Metal, 50 Crystal	Command Center L4
Level 3	+1,000 (total ~1,800)	600 Gold, 5,000 Metal, 200 Crystal	Command Center L5
Level 4	+2,000 (total ~3,800)	1,000 Gold, 10,000 Metal, 500 Crystal	(Future CC6)
Level 5	+5,000 (total ~8,800)	2,000 Gold, 20,000 Metal, 1000 Crystal	(Future CC7)
(The above is illustrative; initial capacity includes CC default. The Vault costs include some crystals from level 2 onward to make high storage an investment.) Now that metal and crystal production are covered, we turn to the modules enabling the advanced gameplay: power generation, exploration, and military units.
Fusion Reactor (Power Generator)
Purpose: The Fusion Reactor provides power (energy) to run advanced modules. Up until the early mid-game, the base’s energy needs were modest and presumably met by an onboard generator in the Command Center or solar panels that come by default. However, when the player wants to operate the Crystal Mine or other energy-intensive structures (like high-tech factories or defenses), a dedicated power source is needed. The Fusion Reactor is introduced at Command Center Level 3, coinciding with the need to power the Crystal Mine. It generates a certain amount of power units, which are consumed by buildings like the Crystal Mine, possibly the Robot Factory, etc. If power demand exceeds supply, those buildings will function at reduced capacity or not at all. Managing power thus becomes a new aspect of the game, adding depth from this point forward (a concept found in many strategy games – for instance, OGame’s mines require energy and you must build Solar Plants or Fusion Reactors to support them
ogame.fandom.com
). Unlock Requirements: Unlocked at Command Center Level 3 (same as Crystal Mine). It has no building prerequisites aside from CC3, but logically the player will build it before constructing the Crystal Mine, because the tutorial will direct them to do so (e.g., “We need a reactor to power the crystal extractor”). Construction & Upgrade: The Reactor can be upgraded to produce more power. Alternatively, the game might allow multiple reactors if more power is needed. In this initial scope, we’ll assume one upgradeable Fusion Reactor to keep things simple. Upgrading increases its output (and possibly fuel efficiency – though we won’t simulate fuel resource for now, assuming it’s self-sustaining fusion or uses common resources minimally). Output & Usage: Let’s say a Level 1 Fusion Reactor provides 10 Power Units. That’s enough to run a Level 1 Crystal Mine (which we said uses ~5 power) and some spare for other small modules. As the base grows, higher-level reactors (or the same reactor upgraded) will provide more power to support multiple high-tier structures concurrently (e.g., Robot Factory, higher-level Crystal Mine, etc.). If more power is needed, the player must upgrade the reactor (or build an additional reactor if that was allowed). This creates a soft cap on expansion – you can’t just run everything at max without the infrastructure to power it. Upgrade Progression:
Fusion Reactor Level	Power Output	Upgrade Cost	Build/Upgrade Time	Prerequisites
Level 1	10 Power units	1,000 Gold, 1,000 Metal	5 minutes	Command Center L3
Level 2	20 Power units	500 Gold, 2,000 Metal, 50 Crystal	15 minutes	Command Center L4
Level 3	30 Power units	1,000 Gold, 5,000 Metal, 200 Crystal	30 minutes	Command Center L5
Level 4	50 Power units	2,000 Gold, 10,000 Metal, 500 Crystal	1 hour	(Future CC6)
Level 5	75 Power units	5,000 Gold, 20,000 Metal, 1000 Crystal, 1 Exotic	2 hours	(Future CC7)
Notes: The initial reactor doesn’t require crystals to build (so the player isn’t stuck in a chicken-and-egg situation of needing power to get crystals and crystals to build power). It costs a fair amount of metal and gold, signaling the entry into mid-game. The upgrade costs do include crystals from L2 onward, meaning once you have crystals, you invest some back to increase power for further growth – a reasonable exchange. At level 1, 10 power covers a Level 1 Crystal Mine (5) and maybe the Robot Factory (say 3) and a bit for other things, so it should suffice. By the time the player builds more power-hungry modules (like an upgraded Crystal Mine or multiple advanced facilities), they’ll need Reactor L2 or L3. If the player ignores reactor upgrades, they’ll find their new buildings can’t run at full capacity. The game UI should indicate power usage and availability (perhaps in the top bar or a power management screen, and modules might show “Powered” or “Low Power” status). This introduces an interesting constraint without overly complicating the early game (since before crystals, everything was low-power enough to not need explicit management). Including a power system is one of those “additional complexities from other games” that enriches the experience. It forces players to allocate resources not just for producing more stuff directly, but for supporting infrastructure, which in turn slows down immediate exponential growth and adds realism. We should ensure, however, that this doesn’t frustrate new players – the tutorial will guide building the reactor at the appropriate time, and early buildings (mining drones, etc.) didn’t require it at all. Only when it’s narratively justified (“Our basic generators can’t handle the crystal extractor’s energy draw!”) do we bring it in.
Attack Robot Factory (Robotics Facility)
Purpose: The Attack Robot Factory is a module that enables the production of combat units – specifically, mechanized attack robots. These robots are used for defense and offense, allowing the player to engage in combat scenarios (like defending the base from threats or venturing out to attack alien nests or rival installations for loot). In the context of our progression, the Attack Robot Factory represents the transition to a military dimension of the game. It comes after the player has established a solid resource income (metal and crystals) because building and upgrading combat units is resource-intensive and often requires advanced materials (exotic items, in this case). The Factory not only builds attack robots but can also be upgraded to improve robot stats or unlock new robot types. Unlock Requirements: Command Center Level 4 is required to build the Attack Robot Factory. The player also needs to have some crystal production capability (hence CC4 implies they have a Crystal Mine from CC3 era). We might also require that the player has at least one Exotic Item available or the means to acquire it, since building the first robot will need an exotic. However, for building the Factory itself, we will not require an exotic item – the structure can be set up with standard resources (plus crystals). The prerequisite can be simply CC4, but we can additionally note that Crystal Mine Level 1 should exist (which it would, because the player needed crystals to upgrade CC4 in our design). So effectively: CC4 (and indirectly Crystal Mine built). Construction Cost: The Factory will be expensive: costing a large amount of Metal and some Crystals and Gold. For example, to build level 1, it might cost on the order of 5,000 Metal and 500 Crystals (plus some gold). This ensures the player fully engages with crystal mining to afford it. No exotic item needed just to build it. Unit Production & Exotic Requirement: The key twist is that while the Factory can be built with conventional resources, the Attack Robots it produces each require an Exotic Item (plus metal/crystal/gold) to construct. This is thematically because these robots need a special component (say a quantum AI core, alien alloy, or advanced weapon system) that cannot be fabricated with base resources alone. Thus, to actually produce a robot, the player must have obtained exotic item(s) via exploration. This introduces the need for the Explorer Drone Bay (discussed next) and ties combat units to exploration. It adds a layer of challenge and prevents spamming powerful units without doing the “quest” side of the game. Attack Robots: At level 1, the Factory can produce a basic type of attack robot (e.g. “Assault Droid”). We can imagine this as a mid-sized combat mech or drone that can be used in battles. The specifics of combat are outside this task’s scope (could be AI battles, or player sends them on missions), but for development, we need to define cost and possibly upgrade paths. Let’s say:
Assault Droid (basic robot): Costs 100 Metal, 50 Crystal, and 1 Exotic Item to build; takes e.g. 5 minutes to assemble. Stats might be like 10 attack, 10 defense, etc., just placeholders. The key is the 1 Exotic cost making it a limited asset early on.
The Factory might queue up production (one at a time at first, maybe more if upgraded). Each robot takes time to build. Upgrading the Factory could unlock improved robot types (e.g. a Heavy Robot that costs more and is stronger, unlocked at Factory L2) or allow building multiple robots in parallel (or faster build speeds). Upgradeable: Yes, upgrading the Attack Robot Factory increases its capabilities:
Level 2 might unlock a new robot blueprint (e.g. a heavier attack robot that requires 2 Exotic Items each or something) and/or increase build speed by 50%.
Level 3 could further improve build speed, capacity, and maybe allow minor upgrades to robots (like equipping modules if the game had that).
If we incorporate research, some robot unlocks might require a Research Lab, but since we haven’t introduced a separate research module yet, we can simplify by tying it to factory level or Command Center level.
Defense and Upgrades: The presence of attack robots implies there might eventually be threats (like alien creatures or enemy raiders). The game might require players to build a small force of robots to, for example, clear an asteroid field of hostile creatures to access more exotic items, or to defend against a scripted attack event. Upgrading robots themselves (experience or enhancements) could be a feature, but initially, we focus on building them. We will cover how to upgrade the Factory and by extension get better robots. Upgrade Progression:
Robot Factory Level	Unlocked Units / Effects	Upgrade Cost	Time	Prerequisites
Level 1	Can build Basic Attack Robots (e.g. Assault Droids). Build limit: 1 at a time. Each requires 1 Exotic + 100 Metal + 50 Crystal + 50 Gold. Build time per robot ~5m.	2,000 Gold, 5,000 Metal, 500 Crystal	30 minutes	Command Center L4
Level 2	Unlocks Heavy Attack Robot blueprint (a stronger unit costing 2 Exotics + more resources). Can build 2 robots in parallel (queue size 2). +50% build speed.	1,000 Gold, 8,000 Metal, 1,000 Crystal, 2 Exotic	1 hour	Command Center L5
Level 3	Increases build queue to 3. Unlocks minor Robot upgrades feature (ability to spend resources to boost robot attack/armor by 10%). + another 50% build speed (total 2x faster than L1).	2,000 Gold, 15,000 Metal, 2,000 Crystal, 5 Exotic	2 hours	(Future content, CC6)
Level 4	Unlocks Advanced Robotics (maybe aerial drones or specialized units, future update). Build queue 4.	5,000 Gold, 30,000 Metal, 5,000 Crystal, 10 Exotic	4 hours	(Future content)
Level 5	Ultimate robotics facility: could produce units in batches or prototype a Starship component (stretch goal).	(Very high cost, beyond initial scope)	(Long)	(Future content)
Notes: The Attack Robot Factory Level 1 is one of the most expensive buildings so far, reflecting its advanced nature. The tutorial will ensure by the time the player is to build it, they have accumulated enough metal and crystal. If we set CC4 cost at 5k metal and 1k crystal (as above), after achieving that, the player probably has been running their crystal mine for a bit and has some surplus crystals to spend on the factory. They might still need to gather more metal, but with upgraded mining drones it should be feasible in a reasonable time. The Basic Attack Robot requiring an Exotic Item is a crucial step. The tutorial will at this point shift focus to obtaining that exotic item (via the Explorer Drone Bay, next). We anticipate the player will likely build the Robot Factory, then see that to produce a robot they need an exotic they don’t have, prompting the exploration mechanic. Alternatively, the tutorial might preempt this by having them set up the Explorer Bay first (depending on ordering, we can adjust narrative). But logically, one might build the Factory first (because it’s unlocked immediately at CC4), then realize “I can’t build a robot yet, missing exotic component”. The game could even give a quest at that moment: “Find an Exotic Component to activate your first Attack Robot.” Upgrading the Factory to Level 2 and beyond is probably not immediate for the player in the first gameplay session; that’s more of a longer-term goal. We included it to show that more advanced unit types and faster production come with upgrades – which will motivate players to invest in it as they gather more exotics and resources. For example, a Heavy Attack Robot could be something like a tanky mech that might be needed to take on tougher challenges. It costing 2 exotic items ensures it’s a later game thing, as exotic items are scarce. We should note: no module can exceed the Command Center level, so Robot Factory cannot go to Level 2 until CC is Level 5. We already made CC5 unlock Shipyard, which in turn implies combat expansion. So Robot Factory L2 being at CC5 fits well: by CC5, maybe the game expects you to have a small squad of basic robots and a couple heavy ones, preparing you for more dangerous missions or possibly PvP if that were a thing. Now, the Attack Robot Factory introduces combat but also inherently involves exploration, because of the exotic item dependency. This leads to the next module:
Explorer Drone Bay (Expedition Center)
Purpose: The Explorer Drone Bay is a module dedicated to acquiring Exotic Items through exploration missions. It produces and houses Explorer Drones (or scouts) that venture out into uncharted areas, derelict ships, alien ruins, or distant asteroid fields in search of rare artifacts and components. This module essentially opens up the exploration/idle mini-game aspect of the overall game: while other systems focus on base and resource management, the Explorer Drone adds a way to obtain special items and engage in something active while waiting for builds. It ensures the player “always has something to do” even during long waits
reddit.com
, because they can dispatch explorer drones to gradually gather exotic loot. If the player chooses to play actively, they might manually control some aspect of exploration (which we will introduce in a future update), but for now we focus on the idle/automated approach. Unlock Requirements: Command Center Level 4 (same as Robot Factory) unlocks the Explorer Drone Bay. In terms of sequence, as soon as CC4 is up, the player should be able to build this module. We might not require any other building as prerequisite; however, logically, the player should have started getting crystals by this time (which is ensured by CC3 era). There’s no exotic required to build it (that would defeat the purpose). One might imagine that the Explorer Bay is built using conventional resources and provides the means to get exotics. Functionality:
The Explorer Drone Bay allows the player to build Explorer Drones (similar to how the Mining Hub builds mining drones, but likely explorer drones are more expensive and maybe limited in number).
Each Explorer Drone can be sent on an expedition. This could be represented by a simple timer (drone leaves base and returns in X minutes/hours with something) or by an interactive mini-game (which we plan for later).
Initially, expeditions will mostly yield Exotic Items (perhaps with some randomness). They could also occasionally bring back a bit of resources or intel, but the main goal is exotics.
The module might only allow one expedition at a time at level 1 (one drone out). Upgrades could allow multiple drones exploring different areas concurrently, increasing the haul.
The process can be automated for idle play: i.e., you send a drone, it will always eventually find something. If the player is offline or doing other things, the drone still works. There’s no fail state in idle mode (just maybe varying time).
Later, an active mode could let players directly control or make choices during exploration for potentially greater rewards, but since we’re holding that off, the design now is essentially: Explorer Drone Bay = passive exotic item generator, gated by dispatch times.
Cost to build and operate: Building the Explorer Bay might cost a moderate amount of resources (less than Robot Factory, but still requiring crystals). For example, maybe 2,000 Metal and 200 Crystals, plus some gold. It should be buildable right after CC4, possibly even before Robot Factory if the player prioritizes it. The reason to possibly build it first is to start fetching an exotic while they’re building the Robot Factory, so that by the time Robot Factory is up, an exotic might be ready or close – streamlining tutorial flow. We will reflect that in the walkthrough. Building Explorer Drones might cost some resources too (like 200 Metal, 50 Crystal each, no exotic needed as they’re just scouts). Perhaps the building comes with 1 drone by default or one is cheap to make, to not put too many barriers. Alternatively, we could simplify and say the Explorer Bay inherently has one drone (like a built-in vessel) that you dispatch, rather than building multiples. But upgrades could allow an additional drone slot. Upgradeable: Yes. Upgrading the Explorer Drone Bay could:
Shorten the expedition time (drones get faster engines or better scanners).
Allow sending out more than one drone at a time (multi exploration).
Possibly increase the chance or quantity of exotic items found per trip.
Maybe unlock different types of expeditions in the future (like one for artifact hunting, one for trading missions, etc., beyond initial scope).
Upgrade Progression:
Explorer Bay Level	Exploration Capabilities	Upgrade Cost	Time	Prerequisites
Level 1	Can deploy 1 Explorer Drone at a time. Each expedition takes ~30 minutes and yields 1 Exotic Item (100% chance for one item, possibly more if lucky).	1,000 Gold, 2,000 Metal, 200 Crystal	20 minutes	Command Center L4
Level 2	Can deploy up to 2 drones simultaneously (two separate expeditions). Expedition time reduced to ~20 minutes each (drones have better engines). Slight chance (e.g. 20%) to find 2 Exotic Items in one trip.	500 Gold, 3,000 Metal, 500 Crystal, 1 Exotic	1 hour	Command Center L5
Level 3	3 drones simultaneous. Expedition time ~15m. Higher chance for bonus finds (multiple exotics or rare tech). Can discover new sectors (future content).	1,000 Gold, 5,000 Metal, 1,000 Crystal, 2 Exotic	2 hours	(Future, CC6)
Level 4	4 drones. Further speed and yield improvements.	2,000 Gold, 10,000 Metal, 2,000 Crystal, 5 Exotic	4 hours	(Future)
Level 5	5 drones. Potential for automated continuous missions (drone immediately leaves again unless instructed otherwise).	5,000 Gold, 20,000 Metal, 5,000 Crystal, 10 Exotic	8 hours	(Future)
Notes: At level 1, one expedition taking 30 minutes to get an Exotic means the player will fairly quickly get the item needed for their first Attack Robot (no more than half an hour wait, which in tutorial terms is on the longer side but manageable – the tutorial can have other stuff or simply tell the player to take a short break). We could adjust that time downward for tutorial smoothness (maybe 10 minutes), but we also want to introduce the concept of waiting for rare items. We can strike a balance or maybe script the first expedition to find something faster (like a story event “the first wreck you explore luckily had an intact AI core!” in 5 minutes). The 100% chance for one item ensures the player isn’t gated by RNG for their first needed exotic. In the future, randomization could play a role but initial experience should be reliable. Upgrading to level 2 requires an exotic – interestingly, that means the player would have to find at least one item first, then invest it to improve the Bay. This is a choice: do they use the exotic to build a robot or to upgrade the Bay? Likely they’ll build the robot first (because that’s more immediately fun and also probably a quest objective), and later when they gather a couple more, they might upgrade. We allow that strategic decision. The Explorer Bay adds that side activity while waiting: even if all builds are on countdown, the player can be sending drones out to gather exotics or other goodies. This is in line with design practices of modern idle/incremental games to keep engagement (again referencing how Unnamed Space Idle ensures multiple systems so you’re never bored
reddit.com
).
(Future) Starship Hangar
Purpose: While not necessarily part of the “first portion” of the game that the tutorial covers, it’s worth mentioning the next big step: the Starship Hangar. This module would allow construction of Starships or spacecraft, enabling the player to explore new star systems, engage in space combat, or colonize new areas. It’s essentially the gateway to late-game and expansion beyond the initial base. We include it here to show that our progression path has a next milestone after attack robots and base development. Unlock Requirements: Command Center Level 5 unlocks the Hangar. Building a starship is a massive undertaking, so prerequisites likely include a fully upgraded infrastructure: e.g. Robot Factory Level 1 or 2 (to have advanced assembly tech), possibly Research Lab if one existed, and definitely a significant stockpile of all resources including Exotic Items. Resource Requirements: Starships will cost all resource types in large quantities: e.g. tens of thousands of Metal, thousands of Crystals, and multiple Exotic Items (representing advanced engines, warp cores, etc.). For instance, a small Scout Ship might cost 50,000 Metal, 10,000 Crystal, and 5 Exotic Items. This ensures only a player who has been progressing steadily (with storages upgraded to hold that much, and explorers gathering exotics) can afford it. Gameplay Impact: Building a starship might open up an entire new map or allow the player to travel to a new region (like a new asteroid field or a planet) to access richer resources or unique items. It likely also introduces new challenges (maybe space combat or new alien threats). For now, it's enough to note that the Hangar and starships represent the next tier of complexity, combining everything the player has learned (resource management, unit production, etc.) into a major project. We won’t detail its upgrades since it's beyond the initial game scope, but as a design note: Starship Hangar Level 1 could build a basic scout ship; Level 2 might allow larger ships (freighters, warships) etc., each costing even more resources and maybe requiring further research. This is analogous to how after a certain HQ level, games introduce a new dimension (e.g., Clash of Clans introducing a new resource “Dark Elixir” and new troops, or OGame when you have enough tech to start colonizing new planets). The inclusion of the Hangar ensures our progression path doesn’t dead-end at attack robots – there is a vision for expansion that requires even more granular build-up of complexity: more resources, more exotic components, possibly new resources (fuel for ships?), and broader strategy.
The above covers all major modules and their roles in the first arc of the game. Every module has a clear purpose and is introduced at a time when the player is ready for that complexity. Next, we will outline the tutorial walkthrough that a new player would experience, which ties all these elements together in a coherent sequence. The walkthrough will demonstrate how the game gradually teaches the player to build and use each module, how to gather and spend resources, and how to progress from a tiny base to a multi-resource operation with military capabilities.
Tutorial Walkthrough for First-Time Players
(The following is a step-by-step guide that the game will use to hand-hold new players through the initial gameplay. It is structured in phases, aligned with the progression of modules described above. Each step is what the game or tutorial NPC would prompt the player to do, along with the rationale and any requirements. By the end of this guided experience, the player will have constructed all the key modules (Command Center level 4, Mining Hub, Reactor, Crystal Mine, Storage, Explorer Bay, Robot Factory) and created their first mining drones, mined metal, harvested crystals, found an exotic item, and built their first attack robot. In parentheses, we mention behind-the-scenes requirements or outcomes.) Phase 1 – Establishing Basic Mining: In this phase, the player learns to gather Metal, the foundation of all construction.
Initial Base Setup: The game begins with a Level 1 Command Center already in place on a small asteroid base. The tutorial introduces the Command Center as the core of operations. (It might highlight that CC Level 1 limits other buildings to level 1 for now, and that upgrading it unlocks new possibilities, foreshadowing the importance of the CC
warcommander.fandom.com
.) The player is given a starting stockpile of resources – for example, 1000 Gold and 100 Metal – to get started. The tutorial might provide a brief narrative: “Welcome, Commander! Our goal is to establish a mining outpost to gather resources for our colony. Let’s get started by constructing essential facilities.”
Build a Mining Drone Hub: The first task is to create a way to gather resources. The tutorial directs the player to build the Mining Drone Hub (Level 1). A highlight appears on the build menu for the Drone Hub module. The player spends, say, 300 Gold to construct it (using mostly starting gold, since metal is scarce). Construction is instant or very quick (a few seconds) at this stage. Tutorial tip: explains that the Drone Hub will allow production of Mining Drones, which are needed to mine Metal from nearby asteroids.
Train/Build a Mining Drone: Once the Drone Hub is built, the tutorial guides the player to create their first Mining Drone. In the Drone Hub interface, the player builds 1 drone (cost could be, e.g., 50 Metal, which they have in the starting 100 Metal). If the player didn’t have any metal, the tutorial could have gifted just enough or made the first drone free. Building a drone takes only a few seconds. Tutorial tip: “Mining Drones are the workhorses that extract metal. Let’s build one now. [Progress bar shows the drone being assembled]. Great, we have a drone ready!”
Select an Asteroid Cluster to Mine: Now the game pans to a view of space where at least one nearby Asteroid Cluster is identified. The tutorial might highlight one, e.g., “Asteroid Alpha – rich in Metal”. The player is instructed to assign their new mining drone to that asteroid. They do so via the Drone Hub or a map interface (depending on UI design). Result: the drone departs the base and starts mining the asteroid. The tutorial could show a little animation of the drone leaving, and then a trickle of metal appearing in the resource counter. Tutorial tip: “Your drone is now mining Metal from the asteroid. You’ll see Metal start accumulating. Each trip it will bring back some Metal to the base. More drones = faster mining.”
Observe Metal Income and Collect if Needed: The game might speed up a few seconds to simulate the drone returning with its first haul (say 50 Metal). The Metal resource counter goes up. The tutorial points out the resource bar, showing Metal increasing. It might also mention Gold, but note that Gold isn't being produced actively right now. Possibly the asteroid also yields a tiny bit of gold with each trip (the player might notice a +5 Gold, optional). Tutorial tip: “Metal (grey resource) is used for construction. We’ll need a lot of it. Let’s wait for the drone to gather some.” (The player waits a short moment or the tutorial auto-completes a small amount of metal to move on.)
Build a Second Mining Drone (Optional): If the Drone Hub supports 2 drones at level 1 (which it does), the tutorial can encourage building another drone with the newly mined metal. Tutorial prompt: “Let’s increase our metal output by building a second mining drone.” The player spends another 50 Metal (which they now have from the first drone’s trips) to create Drone #2. They then assign the second drone to perhaps the same asteroid or if a second asteroid is available, the tutorial might introduce it now: e.g., “A second asteroid cluster is in range. This one has some gold mixed in with metal.” The player could choose to send the new drone to Asteroid Beta (with maybe 20% gold yield, 80% metal) just to illustrate choice. Either way, now two drones are working. Metal income is effectively doubled. (If two asteroids are being mined, they might see a trickle of gold too, which can be pointed out as a bonus, though not needed immediately.)
Build Metal Storage (Metal Depot): After a short time of mining, the player’s metal stockpile is growing. The tutorial now checks if the player is nearing the initial storage limit (which was perhaps 1000 Metal max at CC1). To prevent hitting the cap and to introduce storage, it prompts the player to build a Metal Depot. Tutorial tip: “We need to ensure we can store enough Metal for bigger projects. Construct a Metal Depot to expand our metal storage capacity.” The player builds Metal Depot Level 1 (costing a bit of Gold, which they still have plenty of). This takes maybe 30 seconds. Once built, the metal capacity increases (e.g., from 1000 to 3000). The tutorial might show the capacity indicator. Tip: “Good, now we can hold up to 3,000 Metal. That will be important for upgrading our Command Center and other buildings.”
Upgrade the Mining Drone Hub (to Level 2): With metal coming in, the tutorial suggests improving the mining operation. Prompt: “Upgrade your Mining Drone Hub to support more drones and faster mining.” The player clicks upgrade on the Drone Hub. Prerequisite: Command Center must be Level 2 to allow Hub Level 2. At this point, the Command Center is still L1. So the game actually needs them to upgrade the Command Center first (which is the next step). Perhaps the tutorial does the Command Center first instead. Let’s adjust the order: likely, the game will have the player upgrade the Command Center to level 2 before upgrading other buildings, because CC is the gate. Thus, instead of upgrading Drone Hub just now, the tutorial will focus on Upgrading Command Center to Level 2 as the next big step.
Upgrade Command Center to Level 2: As soon as the player has enough Metal (the requirement for CC2 is 600 Metal as per our design) – which should happen after a short period of mining – the tutorial instructs them to initiate the upgrade. Prompt: “We’ve gathered enough Metal to improve our Command Center. Upgrading the Command Center will expand our base and unlock new structures. Let’s do that now.” The player spends 600 Metal (and some gold) to upgrade CC to Level 2. Build time might be a few minutes, but the tutorial might fast-forward or make it very short for this guided section. After upgrading, the CC level displays “2”. Effect: The game notifies that new buildings are now available (maybe a Crystal Mine is listed but still locked until CC3, but Metal Depot upgrades or a Gold Vault might now be available; more importantly, existing modules can now go to level 2).
A quick note or celebration: “Command Center upgraded! We can now develop our base further.” Perhaps the base visually grows a bit. The tutorial might highlight that other modules can now be upgraded to 2.
Upgrade Mining Drone Hub to Level 2: Now that CC2 is achieved, the tutorial returns to the mining operation improvement. The player is prompted again to upgrade the Drone Hub. Prompt: “Upgrade your Mining Drone Hub to increase the number of drones we can deploy.” The player initiates the upgrade for the Drone Hub to L2 (costing some gold and metal, which they should have – e.g., 500 Gold and 200 Metal). Time maybe 1 minute. Once done, the Hub now allows 4 drones. The tutorial could suggest building additional drones to take advantage of this. If the player has resources, they can build drones 3 and 4. If not immediately, they can wait as metal accumulates. Usually, a tutorial might gift a bit to allow it, or simply tell them “you can build more drones when you have metal.” Let’s say they manage to build at least a third drone. They assign it to whichever asteroid is free or even the same one (multiple drones can work one asteroid presumably). At this point, the base is humming along with improved metal production. The player has learned building construction, unit (drone) production, resource collection, and upgrading a building and the CC. Phase 1 is essentially complete: the player has a stable metal income.
Phase 2 – Expanding into Crystal Resource: Now that the player has a firm grip on metal, the game introduces Crystals, the next tier resource. But to do so, the player must perform a series of preparatory steps: upgrading the Command Center again, providing sufficient energy, and then constructing the Crystal Mine. Phase 2 teaches the player about power (Fusion Reactor) and a new resource production chain.
Aim for Command Center Level 3: The tutorial now sets the goal to unlock crystal mining. Narration: “Our base is ready to venture into more advanced technology. Sensors indicate valuable Crystal deposits in the vicinity, but we need to upgrade our Command Center to extend our reach and capabilities.” The player is instructed that CC3 is the next objective. The requirement for CC3 is 3,000 Metal (and 1,500 Gold). To reach this, the player will likely need to accumulate resources for a bit.
Resource Check: At this point, with 3 drones working (maybe ~150 Metal/min total), it will take some minutes to gather 3,000 Metal. The tutorial encourages the player to perhaps upgrade storage or build another if needed: Since CC3 requires 3,000 Metal and our capacity is exactly 3,000 after one Metal Depot, the player can manage. If they hadn’t built the Metal Depot earlier, they’d be capped at 1000 and couldn’t gather 3000. But we did instruct building it. To be safe, the tutorial could double-check: if metal cap is <3000, it must prompt building or upgrading storage now. Assuming we followed the earlier step, they have cap 3000 which is just enough.
The tutorial might advise: “While waiting for enough Metal, consider upgrading your Metal Depot or adding a second one to increase capacity and efficiency.” However, one depot at level 1 is sufficient for 3000 exactly. Possibly upgrading Metal Depot to level 2 (capacity 8000) would be forward-thinking, but not strictly required yet. Let’s suppose the player decides to upgrade Metal Depot to level 2 as well (costing some gold and 100 Metal, quick to do). Now capacity goes to 8000, which is plenty. This is optional but likely the tutorial might mention it.
After a short period (maybe the game speeds up generation or the tutorial gifts some metal to not stall), the player reaches 3,000 Metal.
Build the Fusion Reactor: Before upgrading CC3 or concurrently, the tutorial might introduce the need for energy. Actually, CC3 unlocks building the Reactor and Crystal Mine, but the player can’t build them until after CC3 is completed. However, the narrative can warn: “To harness crystal deposits, we’ll need a powerful energy source.” Possibly even before hitting the upgrade button for CC3, the base’s computer or advisor says: “Commander, extracting crystals will require more power than our basic systems can provide. We should construct a Fusion Reactor once available.” However, since Fusion Reactor is only available at CC3, the player can’t build it yet. So perhaps we should actually have them upgrade CC to 3 first, then immediately build Reactor. Let’s do it sequentially:
Upgrade Command Center to Level 3: The player now has the 3,000 Metal and other resources to upgrade CC to 3. They initiate the upgrade. Prompt: “Upgrade Command Center to Level 3 to unlock Crystal mining capabilities.” This might take, say, 15 minutes base time, but the tutorial might expedite it or at least say “15 minutes” and perhaps complete near-instantly for teaching purposes. Once CC hits level 3, new modules become available: Fusion Reactor and Crystal Mine (the game likely pops up a message: “New building available: Fusion Reactor. New building available: Crystal Mine.”). The game could play a short flavor text: “Your Command Center has been upgraded to Level 3. Long-range scanners have extended our view – we’ve detected crystalline deposits in a nearby asteroid cluster! Now we have the opportunity to gather Crystals, a resource vital for advanced technology. We must build the infrastructure to power and extract these crystals.”
Build Fusion Reactor (Level 1): Immediately after CC3 upgrade, the tutorial directs: “Construct a Fusion Reactor to generate the energy required for advanced modules.” The Fusion Reactor is now buildable. The player spends, say, 1000 Gold and 1000 Metal to build it (they should have accumulated enough metal beyond the 3000 used for CC, since drones were likely still mining during CC upgrade time; if not, they might need a bit more metal first – but likely it’s fine). The Reactor takes maybe 5 minutes to build, which the tutorial speeds up or keeps the player occupied with some info about power. After construction, the Reactor comes online and the UI might show “Power: 10/10 units available” or similar. Tutorial tip: explains the power system: “The Fusion Reactor generates energy. Some buildings (like the upcoming Crystal Mine) consume energy to operate. Ensure your power output is always >= consumption for optimal performance
ogame.fandom.com
. You can upgrade the reactor or build more if needed to increase energy.” (We might cite that OGame concept indirectly that higher production needs more energy). Now the base has power capacity ready. Possibly at this point nothing is using significant power yet, so we have surplus (10/10 free).
Build Crystal Mine (Level 1): With energy in place, the main goal of Phase 2 is reached: building the Crystal Mine to start obtaining crystals. The tutorial instructs: “Construct a Crystal Mine to begin extracting Crystals from the newly detected deposit.” The player chooses a location and builds the Crystal Mine. Cost: 1,000 Gold and 2,000 Metal (which after the CC upgrade might have to be re-farmed a bit; the tutorial might ensure they had some reserves or the CC upgrade didn’t drain gold completely). If they are short on metal now, the drones will have continued gathering during reactor building, etc., so they likely have enough or close. Possibly a brief wait or the tutorial grants a chunk of metal to cover it. Building the Crystal Mine might take 10 minutes normally; the tutorial again can expedite it to show the results. Once built, the Crystal Mine is now operational. It likely immediately starts producing a small amount of crystals. Maybe it shows “0/20 crystals” filling up as time passes. The tutorial indicates: “Crystal Mine online. It will continuously extract Crystals. You can see the output in the resource bar (Crystal icon). Initially, extraction is slow – consider upgrading it when possible to increase yield.” It also notes: “The Crystal Mine consumes a lot of power. Check your power meter.” The player sees that, say, 5/10 power is now used. Tutorial tip: “Our reactor is supplying enough energy for now (Power usage 5/10). If we add more high-power modules or upgrade this mine, we’ll need to ensure we have enough energy available by upgrading the Fusion Reactor.”
Crystal Production and Collection: Now the player has access to Crystals. The tutorial may wait a moment for a few crystals to be produced (or instantly add 1 or 2 to illustrate). Possibly an in-game hour is too long, so they might simulate e.g. 1 crystal appears after a few seconds just to show the mechanic. The player is shown how to collect crystals from the Crystal Mine if needed (depending on mechanics: maybe they have to tap the mine to transfer crystals to storage). Tutorial prompt: “Collect the Crystal from the mine to add it to your stockpile.” The player does so, and their Crystal resource counter goes up (e.g., from 0 to 1). Also, if not already done, the tutorial would now mention Crystal Storage (Crystal Vault): “To store more than a handful of Crystals, build a Crystal Vault.” Since initial capacity might be low (say 100), to accumulate enough for upcoming tasks (like Robot Factory needing 500 crystals), they will need storage. If initial CC storage is only 200 and Robot Factory requires 500, the tutorial must enforce building Crystal Vault. So:
Build Crystal Vault (Storage): Prompt: “Build a Crystal Vault to increase our crystal storage capacity. We will need to stockpile enough crystals for future projects.” The player constructs a Crystal Vault level 1, costing maybe 500 Gold and some metal (which they should have). Time short. Once built, crystal capacity jumps (to, e.g., 300 total). If our Robot Factory cost is 500 crystals, actually one vault level might not be enough. Possibly we gave initial capacity 500 which might cover it. Let’s assume initial CC gave 500 crystal capacity for ease, or the vault plus CC covers it. If not, they might need to upgrade vault later, but let’s keep numbers consistent: earlier we said CC3 base storage + vault L1 gives ~300, which is below 500. So likely the player will have to upgrade Crystal Vault to level 2 eventually (cap ~800) before building Robot Factory. We can incorporate that when we get there. For now, one vault is built, and they have some capacity for crystals. The tutorial likely doesn’t force upgrading it immediately, but it might hint: “Vaults can be upgraded for even more capacity when needed.”
Upgrade Crystal Mine (Optional): The tutorial might or might not push for upgrading the Crystal Mine to Level 2 now. It depends on pacing. If the game wants to slow the player to gather enough crystals for the next big thing, they might hold off immediate upgrade because upgrading the mine itself costs crystals which the player doesn’t have many of yet. Alternatively, they might say “to accelerate crystal production, upgrade the Crystal Mine.” But that costs 50 crystals which they definitely don’t have yet (the mine just started). It might be premature. Likely, the better approach is to let the player run with Level 1 for a bit, accumulate the crystals needed for the Attack Robot Factory. If the player is proactive, they might upgrade it on their own once they have 50 crystals. The tutorial could leave this as an open suggestion rather than a required step: “Consider upgrading the Crystal Mine when you have enough Crystals to double your extraction rate.” At this point, Phase 2 is essentially done: the player has introduced the second resource and the power system. They have: CC3, Drone Hub L2, Reactor L1, Crystal Mine L1, storages, etc. They are now producing both metal and crystals. The stage is set to introduce the military aspect – building the Attack Robot and obtaining exotic items.
Phase 3 – Developing Military Units and Exploration: In this phase, the player will build their first combat unit (Attack Robot). To do so, they must construct the Attack Robot Factory and obtain an Exotic Item via the Explorer Drone Bay. The game will guide them through setting up exploration and then assembling the robot, thus covering the final pieces of gameplay (combat and exploration loops).
Upgrade Command Center to Level 4: The next major milestone is CC4, which unlocks the Attack Robot Factory and Explorer Bay. The tutorial sets this as the next goal. Narration: “Excellent work, Commander. We’re now mining Crystals and our base is growing. The next step is to strengthen our security and expand our reach. We can develop Attack Robots to defend us and explore further, but we need to expand our command capacity again. Upgrade the Command Center to Level 4.” The player likely needs to gather a significant amount of resources for this: our design said 5,000 Metal and 1,000 Crystals for CC4. This is probably the longest wait so far, especially for crystals. At 5 crystals/hour initially, 1,000 crystals is 200 hours (over a week) – obviously too long for a guided tutorial. Realistically, by now the player might upgrade the Crystal Mine or the game might give some one-time crystal rewards from missions to help. Alternatively, our earlier numbers might be too high for an initial push; perhaps CC4 cost should be lower in practice (like 200 crystals not 1000). To keep momentum, let’s assume that through a combination of the player upgrading Crystal Mine to level 2 (10/hr) and perhaps some starting crystals or a shorter cycle, they manage to accumulate the required crystals in a reasonable timeframe (or the tutorial temporarily accelerates crystal production during this guided section). Meanwhile:
Encourage Base Optimization While Waiting: The tutorial can use this time to have the player check on other things. For example, “While we gather resources for CC4, consider upgrading your Metal Depot and Crystal Vault further, as well as your Fusion Reactor if needed.” If the player’s crystal vault is still too low (e.g. 300 cap and need 1000), they will have to upgrade it. The tutorial can explicitly instruct: “Upgrade your Crystal Vault to store more crystals for the Command Center upgrade.” So the player upgrades Crystal Vault to Level 2 (cap ~800) and maybe Level 3 (cap ~1800) if needed to hold 1000 crystals. Each upgrade costs some metal and a few crystals. They likely have enough metal easily by now (since metal production is high and can accumulate tens of thousands with storage upgrades). So they do that. Now capacity is no issue.
The Fusion Reactor might need upgrading if CC4 or new buildings will strain power. Currently, reactor is L1 (10 power). We know Crystal Mine uses 5, not sure if anything else is heavy yet. Robot Factory might use some power (maybe 3-5), Explorer Bay maybe 2. If all combined, we might exceed 10. It would be good for the tutorial to advise upgrading Reactor to L2 (20 power) before building new stuff, to avoid any power shortfall. So: “Upgrade Fusion Reactor to Level 2 to ensure we have enough energy for upcoming facilities.” If the player has spare crystals and metal they might do it now. Reactor L2 costs 50 crystals (not too bad) and some metal, which they can spare from the CC4 fund if they had extra. This is optional but a wise suggestion. Let’s assume they upgrade Reactor to L2, now power 20, usage still ~5, lots of headroom.
They could also potentially upgrade Drone Hub further or build more drones to speed metal, but metal likely isn’t the bottleneck now, crystals are. Upgrading Crystal Mine to L2 would double crystal speed to 10/hr at cost 50 crystals – absolutely worth it to reach 1000 faster. The tutorial definitely should prompt that: “Upgrade your Crystal Mine to Level 2 to increase crystal extraction rate.” The player does so (once they have 50 crystals, which might have taken 10 hours if unassisted; hopefully either time-skipped or they gave a starting batch of crystals earlier, or maybe the game expects players to do some waiting offline here as part of normal play). Upgrading the mine doubles output, drastically helping reach the CC4 requirement sooner. Now crystals accumulate faster. This could be part of the natural progression where the tutorial might temporarily break and say “Come back later once you have enough crystals to continue upgrading CC.” Many mobile games do that – initial tutorial gets you into mid-game then you continue on your own until another feature unlock triggers more guidance. If we assume the first play session covers through building first robot, maybe they accelerated everything artificially to show it all. However, given the thoroughness expected, maybe it’s okay that not everything happens in one sitting; but for a design guide, we usually describe it linearly. We’ll assume some acceleration or bonus so it’s achievable without literal days.
Eventually, the player meets the resource requirements for CC4. They initiate the upgrade. Prompt: “Upgrade Command Center to Level 4 now that we have the required resources.” It takes 1 hour (maybe sped up again). After completion, the base is now CC4.
Build Explorer Drone Bay: As soon as CC4 is live, the tutorial will introduce the new modules unlocked: Attack Robot Factory and Explorer Drone Bay. It likely suggests building the Explorer Drone Bay first, even though many players might be eager to build the Robot Factory. The reason to do Explorer Bay first is to get started on acquiring an exotic item which is needed before any robot can actually be constructed. If the player builds the Robot Factory first, they will then realize they need an exotic and have to build Explorer Bay and wait. It’s more efficient to kick off the exploration earlier. So the tutorial likely guides this order deliberately: Narration: “Command Center Level 4 achieved! We can now expand our capabilities to include military production and deep-space exploration. Before we can build our first Attack Robot, we’ll need a special component that our scientists call an Exotic Item. We can find such rare items by sending out Explorer Drones on missions. Let’s set up an Explorer Drone Bay.” The player is instructed to construct the Explorer Drone Bay (Level 1). Cost might be 1000 Gold, 2000 Metal, 200 Crystal (from our earlier assumption). The player should have these on hand (especially after focusing on CC upgrade, they likely have leftover metal and possibly some crystals left). They build it, time ~20 minutes (tutorial speeds it up to maybe a minute or instant for demonstration). The Explorer Bay is now built. Tutorial tip: “The Explorer Drone Bay allows us to send drones on expeditions to find exotic components and other valuable artifacts.” Immediately after building, the tutorial likely has them dispatch their first Explorer Drone:
It might either say “Build an Explorer Drone” or automatically provide one. Possibly, similar to the Drone Hub, the Explorer Bay might require constructing a drone unit to send. Let’s say it does: cost might be 100 Metal, 50 Crystal. The player can afford that. They build 1 Explorer Drone (maybe it takes a minute). Alternatively, the Bay could come with one ready. Either way, soon an explorer drone is available.
Send Explorer Drone on Expedition: The tutorial now guides the player to launch an exploration mission for exotic items. Prompt: “Launch an expedition to search for Exotic Items. Select the Explorer Drone Bay, and send a drone to scout derelict wreckage (for example).” The interface might show a destination like “Ancient Shipwreck – 30 min – 100% chance 1 Exotic” as a mission option. The player clicks “Dispatch”. The drone leaves, and a timer begins (30:00). Tutorial tip: “Our explorer is on its way. These missions take some time. Once the drone returns, we’ll hopefully have the Exotic Item we need. In the meantime, we can prepare our Robot Factory.” This is a waiting period. The tutorial can either accelerate it (maybe for the first time it completes in 5 minutes or less) or have the player do something else concurrently. A good idea is to let the player go ahead and build the Attack Robot Factory while the explorer is out, since that itself might take time to build.
Build Attack Robot Factory: Prompt: “While we await the drone’s findings, let’s build the Attack Robot Factory so we can immediately put any exotic component to use.” The player is instructed to construct the Attack Robot Factory (Level 1). Cost: 2000 Gold, 5000 Metal, 500 Crystal as per design. By CC4, the player likely has accumulated those resources again (especially metal is easy, crystal maybe less so but since CC4 needed 1000 and they had that, 500 more isn’t too bad, plus they were still mining during CC upgrade, and perhaps got some as rewards). The tutorial may ensure they held onto some crystals for this or timed it such that after CC upgrade they still had enough left. If not, it might instruct to wait a bit or upgrade crystal mine again etc., but let’s assume manageable. The player builds the Robot Factory, which might take 30 minutes normally. The explorer drone might still be out for some of that time. The tutorial speeds up the factory build as well, or at least ensures by the time the explorer returns, the factory is built or nearly built. Once the Attack Robot Factory is built, the tutorial explains: “The Attack Robot Factory will let us create powerful combat robots. These units can defend our base or be used to secure more resources by force. To build a robot, we’ll need resources – including that Exotic Item we’re searching for.” The player can open the Factory interface and see the blueprint for “Assault Droid” requiring 1 Exotic, 100 Metal, 50 Crystal, etc. Right now, the Exotic count is 0, so the build button might be disabled. The tutorial likely highlights that requirement: “Notice the Assault Droid blueprint requires an Exotic Item. We don’t have one yet – but our explorer should be bringing one soon.”
Receive Exotic Item from Expedition: The expedition timer now completes (or the tutorial triggers its completion as soon as the factory is up, for dramatic timing). A report comes in: “Explorer Drone has returned from the expedition!” The player is notified they found e.g. “1 Alien AI Core” (an Exotic Item). The Exotic Item resource counter increases to 1. The tutorial might present a little narrative: “Success! The explorer recovered a valuable component – an AI Core – from the wreck. This is exactly what we need to program our first Attack Robot.” If the expedition system had some random element, the guaranteed first-time drop ensures the tutorial can proceed. Now the game might also mention that the Explorer Drone can be sent out again anytime to gather more (and in the future, multiple drones or shorter times if upgraded, hinting at that idle loop: “Feel free to send out more expeditions whenever you need exotic resources or have downtime.” Possibly citing that keeping those missions running is good practice to always have something coming in, embodying that no idle time design principle).
Build the First Attack Robot: With the Exotic Item in hand, the tutorial now instructs the player to produce their first Attack Robot. Prompt: “Build an Assault Drone (Attack Robot) using the resources we have.” The player goes to the Robot Factory, selects the Assault Droid, sees cost 100 Metal, 50 Crystal, 50 Gold, 1 Exotic (for example), and clicks build. They have more than enough metal and crystal by now, and exactly 1 Exotic. The robot goes into production, taking maybe 5 minutes. The tutorial might fast-forward it or make it instant to show the result. Once done, a new Attack Robot unit is completed. Possibly there's a little animation of it rolling out of the factory. The tutorial celebrates: “Congratulations! You have constructed your first Attack Robot.” It might prompt the player to tap the unit or show it in a unit list. If there is a place to see your forces, it would be shown. Tip: “You can build additional robots to strengthen your forces, but each will require more exotic components and resources. Upgrade your Robot Factory to build them faster or unlock new types.” (Factory upgrade to L2 is now an option if CC5, but CC5 isn’t achieved yet so maybe not yet. Instead, it could say “when you upgrade CC further, you can improve the factory to unlock more robot types.”)
Demonstrate Robot Usage (if applicable): If the game has any immediate use for the robot, the tutorial might include a quick combat or assignment scenario. For example, perhaps a small hostile event happens: “Alert: Alien creatures are approaching the base!” and the newly built Attack Robot is used to fend them off (this could be a simple automated combat just to show the robot in action). Or it could let the player send the robot on a short mission (maybe to secure another asteroid or salvage site for extra resources). However, including a full combat tutorial might be beyond the scope of this initial base-building guide. But since they wanted to cover making attack robots and upgrading them, perhaps at least instructing how to upgrade the robot itself or acknowledging its role:
Possibly the tutorial says: “Your robot can be upgraded or repaired from the Robot Factory if damaged in battle. Keep an eye on its status.”
Or if there’s a way to send it exploring or attacking for loot (maybe attack some pirate depot to get another exotic), they might hint at that for later.
For now, it may suffice to have achieved the creation of the unit as the milestone.
Wrap-Up and Next Steps: Now the guided tutorial would conclude by summarizing what the player has accomplished and hinting at open-ended gameplay going forward. Narration example:
“In a short time, you’ve built a thriving outpost: a network of mines producing Metal and Crystals, a power reactor sustaining advanced operations, an exploration program recovering rare artifacts, and a robotics factory assembling armed units. You can now continue to expand your base and explore the galaxy at your own pace. Upgrade your Command Center to unlock even more modules (like a Starship Hangar at CC5, which will allow you to build spacecraft to reach new areas). More challenges and opportunities await: you can strengthen your defenses, discover new asteroid fields, encounter alien threats, and research advanced technologies in future updates.” The tutorial might specifically mention the Starship Hangar as a future goal: “For example, at Command Center Level 5, you’ll be able to construct a Starship Hangar, opening the path to build your first spaceship. This will require significant resources and additional exotic parts, so keep expanding your mining operations and keep your explorer drones busy!” This gives the player a long-term target to strive for beyond the tutorial. Also, remind the player of any continuous tasks: “Don’t forget to send your Explorer Drone on regular missions for exotic items while you build and upgrade – you can even let it run while you’re offline, so you’ll often come back to some new exotic components
reddit.com
. Also, maintain a balance: upgrade your resource production, storage, and power supply to support your growing base. There’s always something to do – whether it’s improving buildings, managing your fleet of drones and robots, or exploring for treasures, your colony’s progress is in your hands.” This concludes the tutorial walkthrough. At this point, the player has been introduced to all core gameplay elements:
Base Building and Upgrading: via Command Center and module upgrades.
Resource Management: collecting and storing Gold, Metal, Crystals, and how they feed into build costs.
Power Management: introduced with Fusion Reactor and seeing that Crystal Mine needs power.
Unit Production: building Mining Drones (economic units) and Attack Robots (military units).
Exploration (Idle mechanic): using Explorer Drones to gather exotic items over time.
Dependency Chains: e.g., needing to upgrade CC to unlock buildings, needing Reactor to power Crystal Mine, needing exotic items to build robots – a granular buildup of complexity that mirrors the progression systems of similar games
kixeyesupport.helpshift.com
kixeyesupport.helpshift.com
.
Incremental Progression Philosophy: the game revealed new layers one by one, just as we planned (and as other successful games do
reddit.com
). By the end of the tutorial, the player is engaged with multiple interlocking systems, but because they were introduced gradually, the player understands each one’s purpose and how they interrelate.
Each module introduced in the design has served a tutorial purpose:
Command Center: gating progression and framing the tech tree.
Mining Drone Hub + Drones: basic resource acquisition.
Storage modules: enabling accumulation for bigger projects.
Fusion Reactor: adds a management layer and preps for crystals.
Crystal Mine: introduces second resource and shows need for pre-requisites (power, CC level).
Explorer Bay + Drone: adds an interactive/idle mechanic to fetch special resources, giving the player something to do during waits.
Robot Factory + Attack Robots: introduces combat potential and a tangible goal (build a cool unit), as well as demonstrates the use of the exotic resource.
Upgrades and parallel tasks: The player had to juggle upgrading existing buildings (like improving mines, reactors, storage) to meet requirements for unlocking new content – reinforcing that improving efficiency is necessary to progress (e.g., upgrading Crystal Mine to get crystals faster for CC4).
All these aspects combined ensure a rich, engaging gameplay loop that starts simple and grows complex over time, matching the design goal of “granular build-up of complexity.” We also made sure to incorporate ideas from similar games:

Finally, to fulfill the directive, every module and feature described has a purpose and an incremental introduction in the tutorial. The development team can reference the tables above for exact costs, times, and unlock requirements for implementation. These values can be tweaked for balance, but the relationships (prerequisites and qualitative progression) should remain as designed. By following this guide, Replit’s devs can implement the first portion of the game such that a new player’s experience is smooth, educational, and rewarding – laying the foundation for deeper gameplay to come.
