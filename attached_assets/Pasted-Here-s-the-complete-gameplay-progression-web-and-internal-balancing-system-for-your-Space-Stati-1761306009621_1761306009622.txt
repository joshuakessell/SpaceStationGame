Here’s the complete **gameplay progression web** and internal balancing system for your *Space Station Tycoon / Battle Command* concept.
This structure defines every major **module**, **unlock path**, **research dependency**, and **progression rule** — ensuring there are no dead ends while maintaining a natural increase in time and difficulty.

---

## 1. Core Progression Overview

**Player Flow:**

1. Begin with Central Hub (Level 1) → unlocks Command Core.
2. Build Command Core → allows basic mining and Iron acquisition.
3. Construct Drone Hangar → begin asteroid mining loop.

## 2. Core Modules and Dependencies

| Module                      | Description                                                                       | Unlock Requirement               | Upgrade Dependency                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Central Hub**             | The core of all station operations. Provides base power and controls build limit. | Starting structure               | Must be ≥ all other modules’ levels.         |
| **Command Core**            | Oversees drones, mining, and fleet operations.                                    | Hub Level 1                      | Cannot exceed Hub level.                     |
| **Power Modules**           | Provide energy required for advanced systems.                                     | Iron + Command Core              | Power capacity gates Research and Factories. |
| **Research Bay**            | Allows development of tech trees.                                                 | Power Online                     | Level determines accessible tech tiers.      |
| **Drone Hangar**            | Builds Mining and Planetary drones.                                               | Command Core Level 2             | Higher level = more drones.                  |
| **Drone Factories (S/M/L)** | Constructs combat drones (tiered).                                                | Battle Tech from Research Bay    | Higher levels produce advanced unit types.   |
| **Guild Comm Node**         | Connects station to guilds and trade networks.                                    | Hub Level 3 + Research Tech      | Enables collaboration / shared defense.      |
| **Warp Gate**               | Enables access to Battle Arena (AI or PvP).                                       | Factory Tier 1 built + Warp Tech | Required for matchmaking integration.        |

## 3. Power Generation Module Types

Power dictates build caps, research, and drone production speed.
Each tier provides exponentially higher power yield but at growing material and time costs.

| Module                      | Power Output | Resource Cost                          | Build Time | Notes                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Solar Relay**             | Low          | Iron only                              | 1 min      | Early starter; constant low yield.          |
| **Fusion Core**             | Medium       | Iron + Crystal                         | 5 min      | Stable output, unlocks Research Bay.        |
| **Antimatter Reactor**      | High         | Iron + Crystal + Exotic                | 15 min     | Supports advanced research.                 |
| **Quantum Dynamo**          | Very High    | Iron + Crystal + Exotic + Energy Cells | 30–60 min  | Needed for Warp Gate and high-tier tech.    |
| **Dark Singularity Engine** | Extreme      | Endgame only                           | 12–24 hr   | Powers entire base during large-scale wars. |

## 4. Research Modules and Tech Trees

### 4.1 Station Defense and Offense Research Module

* Unlocks **turrets**, **shields**, **hull plating**, and **countermeasure drones**.
* Each upgrade requires Iron + Crystal + Exotic.
* Early tech: +10% station HP, small railgun.
* Mid tech: automated laser turrets, kinetic shields.
* Late tech: energy barrier + drone-linked defense network.

### 4.2 Drone Technology Research Module

## 5. Planetary Scanning and Exotic Materials

### 5.1 Planet Scanner System

* Unlocked after Research Bay Level 3.
* Operates similarly to asteroid scanning, but finds **planets**.
* Planets contain **unique exotic elements**:

  * Xenon Crystals (energy research)
  * Neutron Isotopes (weapon tech)
  * Helion Dust (warp technology)
  * Quantum Filaments (defensive tech)
* Scanning takes time (3–10 min per planet).

### 5.2 Planetary Drones

* Faster than mining drones.
* Have defensive turrets (can be upgraded).
* Must survive exploration to return exotic materials.
* Research required for:

  * Warp Drives (faster travel)
  * Cargo Expansion (more material per trip)
  * Planetary Shield Emitters (defense vs. hazards)

## 7. Time and Balance System

| Tier                 | Average Time per Upgrade | Example Upgrades               | Notes                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **T1: Starter**      | 0–5 min                  | Mining Drones, Solar Relay     | Instant engagement.        |
| **T2: Expansion**    | 5–15 min                 | Research Bay, Fusion Core      | Introduces idle mechanics. |
| **T3: Combat Ready** | 15–30 min                | Drone Factory, Warp Gate       | Unlocks first battles.     |
| **T4: Advanced**     | 30 min–6 hr              | Planet Scanner, Quantum Dynamo | Mid-game depth.            |
| **T5: Strategic**    | 6–24 hr                  | Exotic Tech, Guild Systems     | Long-term retention.       |

Each module’s upgrade curve doubles in cost and time per level but stays under the 24-hour cap.

## 8. Balance and Fail-Safe Mechanics

* **No Dead Ends:** At any time, players can:

  * Farm Iron via asteroids.
  * Farm Crystal via Rifts.
  * Scan for new planets for Exotic resources.
* **Energy Bottleneck System:** Power limits growth rate, creating a natural pacing gate.
* **Research Tiers:** Require multiple resource types, ensuring diversity in gameplay loops.
* **Hub Hierarchy Rule:**
  No module can exceed the Hub’s level → ensures balanced expansion.
* **Instant Gratification Layer:**
  Early construction times (1–15 min) keep new players hooked.
* **Late Game Patience Layer:**
  High-tier modules cap at 24 hr for major upgrades (but with idle rewards).

## 9. Future-Ready Systems for AWS Integration

When expanded:

* **Warp Gate** will act as the matchmaking trigger.
* **Battle Drone Factory** units will sync with GameLift session templates.
* **Guild Node** will connect via AWS GameLift or GameSparks services for co-op PvE events.

Would you like the next step to be:

1. A **visual dependency chart** (tech tree + resource flow), or
2. A **data table** version formatted for import into Replit (JSON or CSV format for module definitions)?
